_Streamlit_ is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. Create beautiful data apps in hours, not weeks. All in pure Python. All for free.

Below are some of the apps which I have developed using Streamlit.

### Movie Recommendation Engine

----------------------------------------------

A simple movie recommendation appplication developed using spacy, scikit learn and streamlit. Here the movies similarity is generated based on the movie plots or overview data. This is a very simple machine learning based application. This is just scratching the surface of what is possible with the magical **Streamlit**.
